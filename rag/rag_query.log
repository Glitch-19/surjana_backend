2025-09-14 07:52:52,419 - __main__ - INFO - Answer: Living things and non-living things are different in many ways. Living things share common characteristics such as:

*   **Movement:** They can move on their own.
*   **Need for food:** They need food for energy and growth.
*   **Growth:** They grow over time.
*   **Respiration:** They breathe.
*   **Reproduction:** They can produce new ones of their own kind.
*   **Excretion:** They get rid of waste.
*   **Response to stimuli:** They react to changes around them (like a touch-me-not plant closing its leaves when touched).
*   **Death:** They eventually die.

Non-living things do not have these characteristics. For example, a car can move, but it doesn't grow, eat, breathe, or reproduce. A pencil cannot do any of these things. If something doesn't show these characteristics, it is non-living.
